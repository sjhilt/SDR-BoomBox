## System Requirements

### Hardware
- RTL-SDR dongle (or compatible SDR device)
- Computer with USB port
- Antenna suitable for FM reception

### Software Dependencies

#### Required Command-Line Tools
- **`nrsc5`**: HD Radio decoder ([GitHub](https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5))
- **`ffplay`**: Audio playback (part of FFmpeg)

#### Optional Tools (for full functionality)
- **`rtl_fm`**: Analog FM demodulation (for fallback mode)

#### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required package:
- `PySide6` - Qt GUI framework for the application interface

## Installation

1. **Install RTL-SDR drivers**:
   ```bash
   # macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install rtl-sdr
   
   # Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
   sudo apt-get install rtl-sdr
   
   # Windows
   # Download and install from https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/
   ```

2. **Install nrsc5**:
   ```bash
   # Build from source
   git clone https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5.git
   cd nrsc5
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   sudo make install
   ```

3. **Install FFmpeg** (for ffplay):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ffmpeg
   
   # Linux
   sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
   
   # Windows
   # Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Operation

1. **Launch the application**:
   ```bash
   python boombox.py
   ```

2. **Tune to a station**:
   - Use the frequency slider to select a station (88.0 - 108.0 MHz)
   - Or click a preset button to jump to a saved frequency

3. **Start playback**:
   - Click the "‚ñ∂ Play" button
   - The app will attempt HD Radio first, then fall back to analog FM if needed
   - Select HD channel (HD1-HD4) using the dropdown menu to access different programs on the same frequency

### Preset Management

- **Save a preset**: Right-click on any P0-P3 button and select "Save current frequency" (includes HD channel selection)
- **Load a preset**: Left-click on a preset button (restores both frequency and HD channel)
- **Clear a preset**: Right-click and select "Clear preset"

### Song Statistics

**View your listening history and analytics**:
```bash
python boombox.py --stats
```

The statistics viewer shows:
- **Recent Songs**: Last 20 songs played with timestamps
- **Top Songs**: Most frequently played songs
- **Top Artists**: Artists ranked by play count
- **Stations**: All stations you've listened to
- **Search**: Find songs in your history
- **Time Analysis**: Hourly and daily listening patterns

Songs are automatically logged while using the app. Station IDs and commercials are filtered out.

### Traffic & Weather Maps

![Traffic and Weather Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjhilt/SDR-BoomBox/refs/heads/main/resources/map_traffic_weather.png)

- Click the **Map** button to open the traffic and weather viewer
- Maps are automatically assembled from HD Radio data services
- Traffic data shows real-time road conditions
- Weather radar overlay displays precipitation
- Maps update automatically when new data is broadcast

### System Tray

- The app creates a system tray icon (üìª)
- Right-click for options: Show, Hide, Quit
- Useful for keeping the app running in the background

## Configuration

The application uses these default settings (adjustable in code):

```python
# In boombox.py
@dataclass
class Cfg:
    mhz: float = 98.7          # Default frequency (or P0 if set)
    gain: float | None = 40.0  # RTL-SDR gain
    device_index: int | None = None  # Auto-select device
    volume: float = 1.0        # Audio volume
    ppm: int = 5               # Frequency correction
    hd_program: int = 0        # HD channel (0=HD1, 1=HD2, 2=HD3, 3=HD4)
```

### Fallback Behavior

- **Timeout**: 6 seconds to acquire HD Radio sync
- **Auto-fallback**: Enabled by default (checkbox in UI)
- **Manual control**: Uncheck "Auto analog fallback" to stay on HD only

## Technical Details

### Audio Pipeline

**HD Radio Mode**:
```
RTL-SDR ‚Üí nrsc5 ‚Üí stdout (PCM) ‚Üí ffplay
```

**Analog FM Mode**:
```
RTL-SDR ‚Üí rtl_fm (WBFM) ‚Üí stdout (S16LE) ‚Üí ffplay
```

### Metadata Parsing

The app parses nrsc5 stderr output for:
- Station name
- Station slogan  
- Song title
- Artist name
- Album name
- Synchronization status

### Album Art Fetching

When song metadata is detected:
1. Queries iTunes Search API with artist + title
2. Downloads 300x300 artwork if available
3. Falls back to radio emoji (üìª) if not found
4. Caches results to avoid duplicate requests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"nrsc5 not found in PATH"**
- Ensure nrsc5 is installed and in your system PATH
- Try specifying full path in the code

**No audio output**
- Check that ffplay is installed
- Verify audio device is working
- Check system volume settings

**"No HD sync, switching to analog FM"**
- Normal behavior for non-HD stations
- May indicate weak signal - adjust antenna
- Try increasing gain value

### Debug Mode

Monitor the built-in log window for:
- Decoder output
- Synchronization messages
- Error messages
- Signal status
